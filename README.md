# 👋 Hi there

I'm Denis Vieira, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Software Enginner at ApostaGanha. </br>
With over 9 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.


# 🚀 Expertise

Passionate about crafting interactive and exceptional user experiences, I specialize in back-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 10 years dedicated to honing my skills in back-end technologies, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in web performance.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a back-end Technical Expert as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting tier-down web apps, I embraced leadership responsibilities, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

Outside of the professional environment, I nurture a diverse passion: exploring music, reading books, practicing different martial arts, running, and going to the gym whenever the time allows me. These activities allow me to see another point of view of my environment.
